Recently, our friends at Astral [alerted us to a specific edge case](https://astral.sh/blog/ty) that is a great example of the kind of issues we\u2019ve been aiming to uncover. The specific examples Astral highlighted showed that Pyrefly was taking multiple seconds to recheck files after saving a load-bearing file. This is much slower than normal (when tested across Meta\u2019s codebases, Pyrefly usually takes less than 10 milliseconds to recheck files after saving them) and prompted us to investigate further. Now we\u2019d like to share the story of how that edge case brought to light a performance bottleneck which led us to rethink our underlying approach to diagnostics and dependency tracking, improving Pyrefly\u2019s the speed at which type errors appear by 18x in the process.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nSay you\u2019re working in a very large codebase and have two files open in your editor, A and B.\\n\\n- A is a \u201cload-bearing\u201d file that has many reverse dependencies \\\\- that is to say, many files directly or transitively import A.\\n- B is one of the files that imports A.\\n\\nIncremental type checking should be snappy \\\\- when you edit A and save the file, any effects on the type errors in B should be reflected almost instantly. However, in a small number of cases, we found that updates could take multiple seconds.\\n\\n### How Incremental Updates Work in Pyrefly\\n\\nTo understand how this problem arises, we need to look at how incremental updates currently work. Pyrefly\u2019s analysis operates at the module level, meaning it keeps track of the types exported from each module, as well as the dependencies between modules. Let\u2019s illustrate with a simple example.\\n\\n![import diagram](./blog_imgs/import_diagram_red.svg)\\n\\nThe above image demonstrates a file A that has 4 reverse-dependencies. B1-B4 all rely on the types exported from A.\\n\\nWhen file A is edited & saved, we recheck A to see if any of its exported types also change. If so, we recheck every file that imports A (and if any of those files\u2019 exports changed, we recheck their dependencies, and so on until the change to A has been successfully propagated everywhere). After all of that finishes, we display updated errors in the IDE.\\n\\nThere are two key observations here:\\n\\n1. Our dependency tracking rechecks a module when *any* export changes, even if the module does not depend on the export that changed. This can lead to modules being re-checked unnecessarily.\\n2. We are waiting until the update has completely propagated to every affected file before sending any updated diagnostics, when in practice we mostly care about the files the user has open.\\n\\n## Solution 1: Fine-grained dependency tracking\\n\\nInstead of just tracking whether or not a module depends on another module for invalidation, we can specifically track what\u2019s used.\\n\\nLooking again at the example above, instead of rechecking everything that imports A, with smarter dependency tracking we could only recheck a subset of relevant files:\\n\\n![import diagram improved](./blog_imgs/import_diagram_red_black.svg)\\n\\nBut the types a module depends on are not only from imports. Imagine a program like this with a chained method call:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom module import Class\\nClass().returns_type().operation_on_type()\\n```\\n\\nEven though we only import `Class`, this module still depends on the type returned in `returns_type()`.\\n\\nSimilarly, `returns_type()` could be implemented in a `base` of `Class`, so we really might be depending on a class hierarchy instead of just `Class` from `module`.\\n\\nAnd should a change to an unrelated part of numpy invalidate this program (i.e. recheck the module)? Probably not.\\n\\n```py\\nimport numpy as np\\narray = np.ones(1)\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, a program\u2019s type dependency structure is much more complicated and expansive than it might originally appear.\\n\\nSince Pyrefly v0.51.1, we no longer invalidate a module any time a dependency changes. We now track exactly which types the module depends on at lookup to prune the modules that must be recomputed. In load-bearing files like the example in the introduction, this change turns what could be a 2000+ module invalidation into an invalidation of just over 100 modules.\\n\\n## Solution 2: Streaming diagnostics\\n\\nThe other key insight from earlier is that we\u2019re waiting for the update to finish entirely before refreshing the errors in the IDE, leaving the user waiting multiple seconds in the worst edge cases. To improve this, we could stream updated diagnostics to the IDE as soon as an open file has been rechecked, without waiting for other modules to be rechecked.\\n\\nLet\u2019s imagine a project with a dependency structure that looks like this. A is the file that we are editing, and B is another file that we have open, which is affected by edits to the types in A. As a user, what we want is for changes we make in A to be reflected in B with minimal delay.\\n\\n\\n![nodes diagram](./blog_imgs/a_b_nodes_1.png)\\n\\nHighlighted in red are the reverse dependencies of A, which may need to be rechecked if A is updated. Previously, we would recheck all the red modules before updating the diagnostics for B.\\n\\n![nodes diagram red](./blog_imgs/a_b_nodes_2.png)\\n\\nHighlighted in blue are the transitive dependencies of B. Only changes to those modules affect the types and diagnostics for B.\\n\\n![nodes diagram blue](./blog_imgs/a_b_nodes_3.png)\\n\\nThe image below shows the intersection of A\u2019s reverse dependencies and B\u2019s dependencies in purple. Once those modules are checked, we can show updated diagnostics for open files to the user, while continuing to check the remaining modules (red) in the background.\\n\\n![nodes diagram purple](./blog_imgs/a_b_nodes_4.png)\\n\\nIn order to provide a smooth IDE experience, Pyrefly runs language server operations (e.g. hover, autocomplete, go-to-def) on one thread and rechecks on another thread,  that way users can still use language server features while a recheck is happening in the background. Previously, the main language server thread would send updated diagnostics to the IDE, and only did so once it received a signal from the recheck thread that a recheck had finished. Now with streaming diagnostics in Pyrefly v0.52.0, the recheck thread can emit the diagnostics to the frontend directly.\\n\\nThis change means that diagnostics can now be emitted from both the main thread and the recheck thread. To prevent conflicting diagnostics being sent from different threads, while a recheck is ongoing the main language server thread cannot send diagnostics for files that might need diagnostic streaming. In other words, only one thread may send diagnostics for a given file at a given time.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nCombined, these two optimizations enable Pyrefly to provide updated diagnostics 18x faster than before. Going back to the example from the introduction, these changes reduce the diagnostic update time from ~3.6 seconds to under 200ms on an M4 Macbook Pro. For users, this means type errors refresh instantly after saving a file, a dramatic improvement:\\n\\n<video\\n    src=\\"/videos/18x_faster.mp4\\"\\n    width=\\"720\\"\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"auto\\"\\n  ></video>\\n\\nTo see how we benchmarked this, you can check out testing instructions GitHub [here](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/pull/2344)\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nThis was a tricky case to fix and we\u2019ve made significant progress, but how fast is fast enough?\\n\\nSpeed continues to be a top priority for us on the Pyrefly team.

For example, if you have a variable `x` whose contents you don\u2019t know, an `if isinstance(x, int)` check will narrow the type of `x` to `int` inside the body of the if-statement.\\n\\nSince Python is a [duck-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) language, programs often narrow types by checking a structural property of something rather than just its class name. For a type checker, understanding a wide variety of narrowing patterns is essential for making it as easy as possible for users to type check their code and reduce the amount of changes made purely to \u201csatisfy the type checker\u201d.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll go over some cool forms of narrowing that Pyrefly supports, which allows it to understand common code patterns in Python.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## `hasattr` and `getattr`\\n\\nIn a dynamic codebase where not every field is initialized in the constructor, you may encounter code that dynamically adds attributes to classes without declaring them in the class body.\\n\\nEven if a field is not declared on the class, Pyrefly can understand a `hasattr` check indicates that the field exists.\\n\\n```python\\ndef func(x: object) -> None:\\n\\n   if hasattr(x, \\"value\\"):\\n       val = x.value # Pyrefly knows that `x` has the `value` attribute and won\u2019t error here\\n```\\n\\nSome fields are declared on the class but not always initialized, so accesses have to be done with `getattr`. To support this pattern, any checks on `getattr(x, \u201cfield\u201d)` will generally narrow the type the same way as the same check on `x.field`. This means that using `getattr()` in a guard will narrow the field to be truthy.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Literal, assert_type\\n\\nclass C:\\n    flag: bool  # the flag is not always set`\\n\\ndef func(x: C) -> None:\\n\\n   if getattr(x, \\"flag\\"):\\n       # here Pyrefly knows that the flag is set to True\\n       assert_type(x.flag, Literal[True])\\n```\\n\\n## Tagged Unions\\n\\n[Tagged unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) are a common feature in functional programming languages, but they are not a first-class language construct in Python.  Although Python\u2019s union types are untagged, Pyrefly can emulate a tagged union by creating a union where each member explicitly defines the same field to use as a tag. Pyrefly can then check the value of the field to narrow the union to the corresponding member.\\n\\nThis works for regular classes, as well as typed dicts.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal\\n\\nclass Ok(TypedDict):\\n   result: Literal[\\"ok\\"]\\n   payload: bytes\\n\\nclass Err(TypedDict):\\n   result: Literal[\\"error\\"]\\n   message: str\\n\\ntype Response = Ok | Err\\n\\ndef read(res: Response) -> bytes:\\n   if res[\\"result\\"] == \\"ok\\":\\n        return res[\\"payload\\"]\\n   else:\\n       raise Exception(res[\\"message\\"])\\n```\\n\\n## Tuple length narrowing\\n\\nWhen you check the length of something against a literal integer, Pyrefly will narrow away any tuple types that definitely do not match that length:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import assert_type\\n\\ntype XY = tuple[float, float]   # 2D point\\ntype RGB = tuple[int, int, int]  # color\\n\\ntype Vec = XY | RGB\\n\\ndef describe(v: Vec) -> None:\\n   if len(v) == 2:\\n       x, y = v # Pyrefly knows v only has 2 elements, so it cannot be RGB\\n   else:\\n       r, g, b = v # Pyrefly knows v has 3 elements, so it cannot be XY\\n```\\n\\n## Conditions saved in variables\\n\\nIf you want to check some condition multiple times, you may want to save it to a local variable to avoid repeating yourself. Pyrefly understands this pattern, while also being smart enough to figure out when it should invalidate a saved condition:\\n\\n```python\\ndef f(x: int | str, y: int, z: int | str):\\n\\n    x_is_int = isinstance(x, int)\\n\\n    if x_is_int:\\n        y += x # here Pyrefly knows x is an int and won\'t throw an error\\n\\n    if x_is_int:\\n        y += x # x has not changed, so pyrefly still knows that x is an int\\n\\n    x = z\\n\\n    if x_is_int:\\n        y += x # this is now unsafe, the x_is_int condition is invalidated so pyrefly will throw an error here\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese are just a few of the ways Pyrefly automatically narrows types, reducing the need for explicit casts in your programs. Not all of these features are unique to Pyrefly, but no other type checker as of writing supports the full set of narrowing patterns listed here. Given the lack of standardization of this feature, there\u2019s a lot of room for innovation in the space. We\u2019re currently working on expanding the narrowing patterns we support - so stay tuned for more updates!\\n\\nDo you have a pattern for narrowing types that you wish type checkers could understand, or that you want us to support in Pyrefly?

This integration aims to provide a seamless, out-of-the-box experience, allowing you to statically validate your Pydantic code as you type, rather than solely at runtime. No plugins or manual configuration required\\\\!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSupporting third-party packages like Pydantic in a language server or type checker is a non-trivial challenge. Unlike the Python standard library, third-party packages may introduce their own conventions, dynamic behaviors, and runtime logic that can be difficult to analyze statically. Many type checkers either require plugins (like Mypy\u2019s Pydantic plugin) or offer only limited support for these types of projects. At the time of writing, Mypy is currently the only other major typechecker that provides robust support for Pydantic.\\n\\nRead on to learn more about how this works and how to get started, or watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXYpSQB57YI)!\\n\\n##\\n\\n## **Background \\\\- Pydantic Basics**\\n\\nPydantic leverages type annotations for data validation and parsing. Similar to Python\u2019s built-in `dataclasses`, it helps you create structured data containers in your code. But Pydantic takes it a step further by providing extensive runtime data validation, ensuring that data matches the expected types and formats as soon as it\u2019s instantiated.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\nclass User(BaseModel):\\n    id: int\\n    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)\\n    email: str\\n\\n# Example usage\\nuser = User(id=123, name=\\"Alice\\", email=\\"alice@example.com\\")\\nprint(user)\\n```\\n\\nUsing the code above, if you were to create a User instance, Pydantic would automatically validate the types and constraints. So if you pass invalid data (e.g., `name=\\"\\"` or `id=\\"not an int\\"`), Pydantic will raise a `ValidationError` at runtime.\\n\\n## **Pyrefly & Pydantic \\\\- How it works**\\n\\nSo how does Pyrefly work with Pydantic? For this initial experimental support we focused on delivering the following experiences:\\n\\n- **Understands models and constructs**: Pyrefly supports core Pydantic features, including `BaseModel`, `Field`, `ConfigDict`, as well as model-level configuration. No import errors or pesky red squiggles because your typechecker/language server doesn\u2019t understand what Pydantic is.\\n- **Automatic Recognition**: Pyrefly detects Pydantic models and constructs out-of-the-box. There\u2019s no need to install plugins, add configuration files, or tweak settings. You can just write your Pydantic code and Pyrefly will handle the rest.\\n- **Static Analysis That Reflects Runtime Logic:** One of the biggest challenges with Pydantic is that much of its validation and type coercion happens at runtime. Pyrefly\u2019s static analysis engine is built to reflect Pydantic\u2019s runtime logic as much as possible, ensuring that what you get in your IDE matches what will happen when your code runs.\\n- **Immediate Feedback:** As you write and edit your models, Pyrefly provides instant type errors and warnings. This helps you catch mistakes early, reducing debugging time and improving code quality.\\n\\nFor the full list of supported Pydantic features check out the documentation [here](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/pydantic/#supported-features-with-examples).\\n\\n### Automatic Recognition \\\\- Write Pydantic-ally while Pyrefly gets out the way\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at how Pyrefly works differently to other type checkers, particularly in its unobtrusive approach. A key illustration of this difference is Pyrefly\'s interpretation of strictness.\\n\\nPydantic offers flexible validation modes to suit different use cases:\\n\\n- **Lax (Default) Mode:** In this mode, Pydantic will automatically coerce types where possible. For example, if you pass `\u201d123\u201d`(a string) to a field expecting an int, Pydantic will convert (i.e. coerce) it to `123` (an int). This is convenient for handling loosely-typed input, such as data from APIs or user forms.\\n- **Strict Mode:** here Pydantic enforces exact types, no coercion is performed. If you pass a string to an integer field, you\u2019ll get a validation error. This is ideal for scenarios where data integrity is paramount.\\n\\nThe handy thing about Pyrefly is that it automatically respects your choices on this matter. It reads your model\u2019s configuration (such as `ConfigDict` or model-level config) to determine which mode to apply. For example, in the following code we are explicitly setting the `age` field using strict mode. Pyrefly inspects this statement directly and adapts its analysis to match your intent (in this case by reporting an error if a string age is passed).\\n\\n```py\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\n\\nclass User(BaseModel):\\n    name: str\\n    age: int = Field(strict=True) # strict mode\\n\\n# Pyrefly will report an error here.\\ny = User(name=\\"Alice\\", age=\\"30\\")\\n```\\n\\nAnother useful example of this can be seen with the use of extra parameters. Sometimes when writing Pydantic models you want to allow extra unspecified parameters when creating a model, and other times you want to explicitly forbid it (e.g. by using `extra=forbid`). Whether you\u2019re using either approach or a mix of both in your code, Pyrefly can pick it up automatically from how you\u2019ve written your Pydantic model:\\n\\n```py\\n# Lax mode: We can pass extra fields to our model by default\\nclass ModelAllow(BaseModel):\\nx: int\\n\\nModelAllow(x=1, y=2) # pyrefly won\'t report an error here\\n\\n# Strict mode: we can forbid extra fields\\nclass ModelForbid(BaseModel, extra=\\"forbid\\"):\\nx: int\\n\\nModelForbid(x=1, y=2) # pyrefly will report an error here\\n```\\n\\nUltimately the value here is that you don\u2019t have to manage external configuration files or plugins to get your type checker to work with Pydantic. This is a different approach compared to say Mypy \\\\- which requires you to install a separate Pydantic plugin and configure it via your `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file.\\n\\n## **Getting Started**\\n\\nThere are no special configurations or plugins required to start using Pyrefly with Pydantic\\\\! The steps are as simple as:\\n\\n1. [Install Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/install/) (preferably v2).\\n2. [Install Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) (v0.33.0 or later)\\n3. Write Pydantic models as usual.\\n4. Run Pyrefly / use it in your IDE\\n\\nSimple as that\\\\! If you\u2019d like to have a go playing around with a few examples, we created [a demo repo](https://github.com/migeed-z/pyrefly-pydantic-demo) that you can clone and try out.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nPyrefly\u2019s Pydantic support is experimental and evolving, so you may encounter edge cases or features that aren\u2019t fully covered yet. We\u2019d like to strongly encourage you to try out Pydantic support in your projects and **let us know what works, what doesn\u2019t, and what you\u2019d like to see improved**\\\\!

You can [open an issue in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or [connect with us on discord](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W) if you have feedback to share.\\n\\nLooking ahead, we\u2019re also working on expanding Pyrefly\u2019s capabilities to support additional third-party Python packages that are widely used in the ecosystem. We\u2019re currently focused on adding support for Django and SQLAlchemy, but if there\u2019s a particular library or framework you rely on, please let us know\\\\!

We\u2019ll cover more of the specifics in this blog, but at a high level what this means is that when using a version of Pyrefly with Beta status (v0.42.0 or later) you can feel confident that:\\n\\n* The IDE extension is ready for production use right now,\\n* The core type-checking features are robust, with some edge cases that will be addressed as we make progress towards a later stable v1 release.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 The IDE Experience: Battle-Tested at Meta Scale\\n\\nA major priority for Pyrefly development since the beginning has been to deliver a lightning-fast and scalable IDE experience. Pyrefly was born out of a real-world production problem: Meta\'s Instagram developers were struggling with painfully slow code navigation, autocomplete, and type checking on their massive codebase.\\n\\nOver the past year we\u2019ve been rapidly adding new features and addressing bugs found by our passionate community of alpha testers (both internal and external). We\'re now proud to say **Pyrefly is the default language server and type checker for all developers working on Instagram at Meta**. By testing Pyrefly\u2019s IDE extension on a codebase the size of Instagram we\u2019ve been able to deliver hotly requested features with confidence that they will be reliable for large production codebases.\\n\\nA few examples of Pyrefly\u2019s latest language server features include:\\n\\n#### **Automatic import refactoring**\\n\\nPyrefly will now automatically update your imports when you rename or move a file.\\n\\n<video\\n    src=\\"/videos/IDE-file-rename.mp4\\"\\n    width=\\"720\\"\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"auto\\"\\n  ></video>\\n\\n#### **Jupyter Notebook support**\\n\\nYou can now use Pyrefly with Jupyter notebooks for diagnostics (red squiggles), inlay hints, go-to-definition, hover, semantic tokens, signature help, and completions.\\n\\n<video\\n    src=\\"/videos/jupyter-notebook.mp4\\"\\n    width=\\"720\\"\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"auto\\"\\n  ></video>\\n\\n#### **Third-party stubs shipped with the extension**\\n\\nLanguage server features like hover and autocomplete are now available for third party libraries with Typeshed stubs. This support is available by default, without the need for a config file (`pyproject.toml` / `pyrefly.toml`), to provide a better out-of-the-box experience.\\n\\n<video\\n    src=\\"/videos/typeshed.mp4\\"\\n    width=\\"720\\"\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"auto\\"\\n  ></video>\\n\\nFor a full list of supported IDE features check out the [Pyrefly IDE documentation](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE-features/).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Better Type checking? Check \u2705\\n\\nWe\'ve also made steady progress in improving Pyrefly\'s core type-checking engine since the Alpha release. Our focus has been on achieving higher conformance with the Python Typing Specification while also reducing false positives and improving support for modern Python patterns and popular libraries. In this section we\'ll highlight a few examples of the key fixes, new features, and design decisions that have paved the way for a more reliable type-checking experience in this Beta release.\\n\\n#### **Type Inference**\\n\\nWe understand writing type annotations can be tedious, so from the start Pyrefly has had some capabilities for automatically inferring types for returns and local variables and displaying them in the IDE. Since the first alpha release we\u2019ve been steadily expanding inference capabilities, for example by improving our ability to infer the types of empty containers on first use:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom typing import reveal_type\\n\\ndef f[T](x: T | None) -> list[T]:\\n    return [x] if x else []\\n\\nx = f(None)\\nx.append(1)\\n\\n# Pyrefly is now able to infer that `x` has type `list[int]`.\\nreveal_type(x)\\n\\n```\\n\\n#### **Type Narrowing**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added several new ways to narrow types and reworked type narrowing logic to prevent unwanted \\"pollution\\" of types after checks like `isinstance`:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom typing import Any, reveal_type\\n\\ndef f(x: Any):\\n    if isinstance(x, int):\\n        print(x)\\n    # Reworked type narrowing means the revealed type is now correctly `Any`,\\n    # not `int | Any` as it was previously.\\n    reveal_type(x)\\n```\\n\\n### Preliminary Support for Pydantic and Django\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added preliminary support for two of the most popular Python web/data libraries: Pydantic and Django. Pyrefly can now recognize key objects from these libraries and perform static analysis to catch potential errors before you ever run your code. This support works out-of-the-box with no configuration or plugins required, and includes IDE support.\\n\\n#### **Django Support**\\n\\nAs shown in this example, by default, Django automatically adds an `id` field to serve as the primary key (unless you define a custom primary key). Pyrefly is able to infer that the id exists and is of type `int`\\n\\n```py\\nfrom django.db import models\\n\\nclass Reporter(models.Model):\\n    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=70)\\n    # Django auto-adds: id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\\n\\nreporter = Reporter()\\nreveal_type(reporter.id)  # Pyrefly infers: int\\n```\\n\\nSee more examples in the [Pyrefly Django docs](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/django/).\\n\\n#### **Pydantic Support**\\n\\nIn this example Pyrefly can read your Pydantic model\u2019s configuration directly from your code to determine there is a type error where `age` should be an `int` not a `string`:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\nclass User(BaseModel):\\n    name: str\\n    age: int = Field(strict=True) # strict mode\\n\\n# Pyrefly will report an error here.\\ny = User(name=\\"Alice\\", age=\\"30\\")\\n```\\n\\nSee more examples in the [Pyrefly Pydantic docs](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/pydantic/)\\n\\n#### **Dataclass Transforms Support**\\n\\nAn important addition that laid the foundation for supporting libraries like `attrs` and Pydantic, was allowing Pyrefly to recognize custom dataclass-like class transformations:\\n\\n```py\\nfrom attrs import define  # third-party `attrs` package\\n\\n@define\\nclass C:\\n    x: int\\n\\n# `attrs` uses a dataclass transform, and Pyrefly now recognizes the\\n# auto-generated constructor based on the class attributes.\\nC(x=0)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4c An improved user experience\\n\\nWe understand writing type annotations, dealing with strict checks, and configuring tools can be a barrier to adopting typed Python for many people, so we are always looking for ways to make using Pyrefly as painless as possible, dare we say even delightful? This section highlights some of the incremental improvements we\'ve been working on to improve the overall user experience:\\n\\n#### **Type Error Message Improvements**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also cleaned up our error messages, making them clearer and providing embedded code snippets to pinpoint the exact location of the issue:\\n\\nBefore:\\n\\n```\\nfoo.py:1:5-15: `+` is not supported between `Literal[1]` and `Literal[\'oops\']`\\n```\\n\\nAfter (with snippet and detailed explanation):\\n\\n```\\nERROR `+` is not supported between `Literal[1]` and `Literal[\'oops\']` [unsupported-operation]\\n --\x3e foo.py:1:5\\n  |\\n1 | x = 1 + \\"oops\\"\\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^\\n  |\\n  Argument `Literal[\'oops\']` is not assignable to parameter `value` with type `int` in function `int.__add__`\\n```\\n\\n#### **Smoother migration from MyPy or Pyright**\\n\\nDifferent typecheckers display different behaviour, which can make it a challenge to switch from one to another. While it\'s not always possible to cleanly translate one config option to another, the `pyrefly init` command now does a better job of searching for an existing MyPy or Pyright configuration and transforming it into a `pyrefly.toml` (or `[tool.pyrefly]` section). You can find more details in the [migration guides section](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/migrating-to-pyrefly/) of the Pyrefly docs.\\n\\n#### **A more configurable IDE experience**\\n\\nDo you want type error diagnostics (i.e. the red squiggles) in your IDE or not? Do you want to use Pyrefly\u2019s type errors but not other LSP features? Do you want to pick and choose specific language server features to enable? We know that how you set up your code editor is a personal choice, so we\u2019ve added [more configuration options](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/#customization) to enable you to \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d with your Pyrefly IDE experience.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd2c Enhancing Performance, Squashing Bugs and Aligning with the Spec\\n\\nWe started developing Pyrefly with a clear goal in mind: make a tool that can statically analyze your code, catch type-related bugs, and do it *much* faster than existing tools like Mypy. While performance was good even in the early releases of Pyrefly, on the journey to Beta we\u2019ve been focused on improvements for increasingly complex codebases, reducing type checking time and addressing edge cases for projects of varying size with many dependencies.\\n\\nIn some cases we\u2019ve been able to reduce the time it takes to type check large projects with virtual envs, node-modules and other large dependencies by over 95% compared to earlier alpha versions of pyrefly. We\'ve also closed **over 350 bug issues** opened by users and have been using the [Python typing conformance test suite](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/python/typing/blob/main/conformance/results/results.html) to benchmark our progress towards fully implementing the typing specification. So far we\u2019ve gone from **39% conformant at alpha launch to over 70% conformant today.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot more that\u2019s been happening than we can possibly be squeezed into one blog post, so if you\u2019d like to take a look back in more detail you can check out the completed [beta milestone](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/milestone/4) or our previous [release notes](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/releases).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nThis Beta release marks a significant milestone, but the journey isn\'t over\\\\! We\u2019re now focusing on the further work that is needed to bring you a stable v1.0 release next year, including:\\n\\n* Adding further support for popular third-party libraries (especially Django and Pydantic integration).\\n* Implementing the remaining missing features from the Python type system to reach 100% conformance.\\n* Making Pyrefly work even faster and consume even less memory\\n* Fixing more bugs\\\\!\\n\\nWe\u2019d also like to say a huge thank-you to everyone who has helped get Pyrefly to this release. Whether you\u2019ve contributed to the codebase, opened GitHub issues or just commented with your questions and feedback, your contributions have helped shape the direction of this project thus far.

In particular, improvements related to static typing can improve developer experience and help downstream libraries write safer code. We\'ll tell the story about how we (Quansight Labs, with support from Meta\'s Pyrefly team) helped bring its type-completeness score to nearly 90% from an initial 33%.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**TL;DR**:\\n\\n- NumPy\'s type-completeness score was ~33%.\\n- A one-line fix doubled coverage to over 80%.\\n- Fully typing MaskedArray pushed the score to nearly 90%.\\n- What\'s left? Top-level `numpy.ma` functions, more precise overloads, and adding a type-checker to NumPy\'s CI.\\n\\n## Wait, what\'s type completeness?\\n\\nModern IDEs use type annotations to help developers by showing them helpful suggestions and highlighting syntax. [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is a popular type-checker which, as well as checking for correctness and consistency, can also measure what percentage of a library\'s public API has type annotations. We call the percentage of fully-typed symbols exported by a library the _type-completeness score_.\\n\\nFor example, a module which exports functions `foo` and `bar`:\\n\\n```python\\ndef foo(a: int):\\n    return None\\n\\ndef bar() -> int:\\n    return 1\\n```\\n\\nwould have a 50% type-completeness score, because:\\n\\n- `foo` is partially unknown, as it\'s missing a return annotation.\\n- `bar` is type-complete.\\n\\nBy changing the `foo` signature to be `def foo(a: int) -> None:`, the type-completeness score would jump to 100%. The more type-complete a library is, the more helpful the suggestions an IDE can show to the user.\\n\\nNote that type-completeness only measures how much of the public API (at least, the part known to Pyright) is covered by types. If you want to verify that those types are correct and self-consistent, you\'ll also need to run a type checker. The most used type checkers currently are [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) and Pyright, but [Pyrefly](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly) and [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) are also attracting a lot of attention due to their impressive performance characteristics (note however that neither yet describes itself as production-ready, so temper your expectations accordingly if you try them out!).\\n\\n## How type-complete is NumPy?\\n\\nWhen we started this effort (in March 2025), we first tried measuring NumPy\'s type-completeness by running:\\n\\n```console\\npyright --verifytypes numpy\\n```\\n\\nThe output showed a completeness score of...18%. Wait, only 18%? This seemed very low, because by then typing efforts in NumPy had been ongoing for some time. Was something up with the metric? Upon closer inspection of the output, we noticed a few things:\\n\\n- Some objects, such as `DTypeLike`, were reported to be \\"partially unknown\\", even though they had type annotations.\\n- The type-completeness report included test modules such as `numpy.tests.test_matlib`.\\n\\nThe first issue was caused by an import from the standard library `decimal` module, which itself is partially untyped. Given that this is outside of NumPy\'s direct control, we decided to exclude it from the coverage report by using `--ignoreexternal`, [as suggested by Eric Traut](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/discussions/9911).\\n\\nFor the second issue, Pyright gives us an option to export the coverage report to json (`--outputjson`). We could then parse the json and exclude `numpy.tests`. Given that NumPy users wouldn\'t ordinarily interact with NumPy\'s internal test suite but that Pyright considers it public, we decided that it made sense for us to exclude tests in order to focus our efforts on what would make the biggest user-facing impact.\\n\\nOnce we\'d addressed the two steps above, the baseline type-completeness score became 33%. This was our starting point. We could then focus our efforts on the remaining 67%!\\n\\n## The one-line change which doubled type-completeness\\n\\nPyright\'s report includes classes, methods, functions, type aliases, and more. A lot of scientific Python code centres around some central classes such as `numpy.ndarray`. `ndarray` was reported as \\"partially unknown\\", but eye-balling the exported symbols related to that class revealed something interesting:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> np.mean([x[\'isTypeKnown\'] for x in exported if x[\'name\'].startswith(\'numpy.ndarray.\')])\\nnp.float64(0.9811320754716981)\\n```\\n\\nSo, `ndarray` was reported as \\"partially unknown\\", but 98% of its methods had known types. It shouldn\'t be much effort to bring that number to 100%! In fact, all it took was a [one-line change to fix a typo in a type annotation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28908):\\n\\n```diff\\n- def setfield(self, /, val: ArrayLike, dtype: DTypeLike, offset: CanIndex = 0) -> None: ...\\n+ def setfield(self, /, val: ArrayLike, dtype: DTypeLike, offset: SupportsIndex = 0) -> None: ...\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it! `CanIndex` was an unknown symbol and was probably mistyped, and replacing it with the correct `SupportsIndex` one brought NumPy\'s overall type-completeness to over 80%! We then started examining other NumPy classes to see if there was anywhere else where we could make an impact, and hopefully a much larger one.\\n\\n## Enter MaskedArray\\n\\nWhen we looked at the percentage of typed symbols from the MaskedArray class, we noticed something interesting:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> np.mean([x[\'isTypeKnown\'] for x in exported if x[\'name\'].startswith(\'numpy.ma.core.MaskedArray.\')])\\nnp.float64(0.2)\\n```\\n\\nOnly 20% of them were typed! That\'s quite a contrast with `ndarray`, which was already at 98% when we started. It\'s also a fairly widely used class, appearing in the codebases of pandas, scikit-learn, and xarray. Given how poorly typed it was, we decided it would be a good candidate to spend time on!\\n\\n## Typing MaskedArray\\n\\nThe main difficulty in typing NumPy code isn\'t inferring the possible argument values (which is quite easy to do with automated tools), but rather dealing with the large number of overloads. This is because many of NumPy methods\' return types depend on the exact combinations of the input types. For example, suppose we have a `MaskedArray` `ma` and want to count the number of non-null values:\\n\\n- `ma.count()` returns an integer.\\n- `ma.count(axis=0)` returns an array.\\n- `ma.count(keepdims=True)` also returns an array, of the same shape as the input array.\\n\\nWe can type this by having a different overload of each of these different cases. This is a relatively simple example, but there are others where the number of necessary overloads was as high as 9! This isn\'t something which is easy to automate, and requires careful reading of the documentation and of the source code. It\'s a non-trivial amount of work.\\n\\nBut...we pulled through it, and thanks to some very timely and constructive reviews from the amazing [Joren Hammudoglu](https://github.com/jorenham), MaskedArray is now reported as 100% type-complete! As for the overall type-completeness, that\'s now at 88%. So...what\'s left?\\n\\n## What\'s missing from NumPy?\\n\\nIn the MaskedArray module, there\'s still some untyped top-level functions, such as `numpy.ma.count`. Overloads could be made more precise and shape-preserving (e.g. if the input is 2D, then make sure to preserve this fact in the output where possible). There\'s some missing defaults in the stubs. There\'s no shortage of work here.\\n\\nThe biggest missing bit, however, is the elephant in the room: NumPy doesn\'t run a type-checker over its codebase in CI. It has some typing tests, sure, but that\'s different from running a type-checker. If any motivated reader is interested in making a significant open source contribution, then getting NumPy\'s typing into a state such that a type checker (and possibly even [stubtest](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubtest.html)) can be run over it could be a great use of your time.\\n\\n## Conclusion, acknowledgements\\n\\nWe\'ve looked at how we contributed towards increasing NumPy\'s type-completeness. Given how widespread NumPy\'s adoption is, we expect this effort to have been an impactful one. We look forward to seeing what else we can achieve in this space - thank you to [Meta and Quansight Labs](https://discuss.python.org/t/call-for-suggestions-nominate-python-packages-for-typing-improvements/80186/1) for having funded and facilitated this effort!"},{"id":"/2025/09/15/ide-extension","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/09/15/ide-extension","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-15-ide-extension.mdx","title":"Give your Python IDE a Glow-Up with Pyrefly","description":"Learn how Pyrefly\'s language server capabilities can help you navigate large Python codebases with ease.","date":"2025-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"language-server","permalink":"/blog/tags/language-server"},{"inline":true,"label":"IDE","permalink":"/blog/tags/ide"}],"readingTime":6.31,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abby Mitchell","url":"https://github.com/javabster","key":"abbym","page":null},{"name":"Kyle Into","url":"https://www.kylei.dev/","key":"kylei","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Give your Python IDE a Glow-Up with Pyrefly","description":"Learn how Pyrefly\'s language server capabilities can help you navigate large Python codebases with ease.","authors":["abbym","kylei"],"tags":["language-server","IDE"],"image":"https://pyrefly.org/assets/images/ide-blog-hero-22aa9f0c1c4873f0e6c18e02faf40823.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Bringing NumPy\'s type-completeness score to nearly 90%","permalink":"/blog/numpy-type-completeness"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Today\u2019s Python Developers Are Embracing Type Hints","permalink":"/blog/why-typed-python"}},"content":"{/*\\n * Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.\\n *\\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\\n */}\\n\\n![](./blog_imgs/ide-blog-hero.png)\\n\\nThe challenges of managing ever-growing codebases are hardly new. As far back as 1995, Niklaus Wirth, (creator of programming language Pascal) already emphasized the importance of keeping software lean in his essay [A Plea for Lean Software](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.inf.ethz.ch%2Fwirth%2FArticles%2FLeanSoftware.pdf&h=AT2RMg0sKqoJzLiFe4OIBZRxVLklBs9SeIlBrZnHnaEVP2VVCAG8Z9vuiFo4kP_MoegKDrRBKhxV_0cuWBijok2KhvKG9nLhUm5USFJC2Nzlq8yhSOvWirfU_BnPIve4Ofo7c-emKgWgbBEI3w). Fast forward to today: many programmers still face the reality that, despite their best coding intentions, as projects grow in size and complexity, so do their codebases. Even when a project scales to millions of lines of code, developers still expect their IDE to be fast, accurate, and efficient. And with increasingly large and interconnected (dare I say, spaghetti?) code, you probably rely on your IDE even more to help you navigate the chaos (ahem I mean complexity).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBut what you may not have thought about before is that scaling project size presents a real challenge for your IDE: how do you keep code navigation tools responsive and reliable when the codebase keeps expanding? In this blog, we\u2019ll explore this challenge and introduce you to Pyrefly \\\\- a scalable language server and typechecker designed to keep your Python development experience smooth and snappy at scale.\\n\\n## **Background \\\\- What is a Language Server and Why Does It Matter?**\\n\\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a standardized way for code editors to communicate with language-specific servers that provide features like autocomplete, go-to-definition, and symbol renaming. Instead of each editor implementing these features separately, LSP allows a single language server to support multiple editors. Pyrefly\u2019s language server capabilities are based on the [Language Server Protocol Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) and are designed to still be blazing fast even on code bases with over 20 million lines of code.\\n\\nA key capability of many language servers, including Pyrefly, is typechecking, which enhances IDE features by providing type diagnostics. Pyrefly\u2019s language server not only reports type errors like basic type checkers, such as [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), but also replaces core IDE functionalities including \u201cfind definition,\u201d hover (displaying types and docstrings), and completions. By consolidating these features, Pyrefly ensures that the types it checks and the types displayed in your IDE will always match.\\n\\n## **Instagram \\\\- A Case Study on the Pain of Slow Code Navigation**\\n\\nMeta operates an incredibly large Python codebase \\\\- a massive monorepo containing **almost 1.5 million Python files** maintained by thousands of developers. Instagram is one of those projects, with **over** **20 million lines** of Python code. At this scale, even simple navigation tasks like jumping to a function definition, searching for references, or loading syntax highlights could take almost a minute in the worst cases. That may not sound like a lot on its own, but experiencing it every few minutes quickly becomes frustrating and has a tangible impact on developer productivity, especially when multiplied across a large company like Meta.\\n\\nPyrefly emerged in part to address this exact challenge (you can read more about our origin story in our [intro blog](https://pyrefly.org/blog/introducing-pyrefly/)). In real world use cases, developers who switched from Pyright (the default LSP for VSCode) to Pyrefly spent **98%** less time waiting on hover results and go-to definition was **\\\\~10x** faster. On the slowest files (p99), these IDE responses grew from an order of minutes to seconds (**30x** improvement). If those numbers are hard to visualise, the TL;DR is that this upgrade took instagram developers from questioning \u201cis my editor frozen?\u201d to not giving their IDE a second thought.\\n\\n<div style={{ display:\'flex\', flexDirection: \'row\', maxWidth: \'100%\' }}>\\n  <video\\n    src=\\"/videos/pyrefly-ide-comparison.mov\\"\\n    style={{maxWidth: \'50%\'}}\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"metadata\\"\\n  ></video>\\n  <video\\n    src=\\"/videos/pyright-ide-comparison.mov\\"\\n    style={{maxWidth: \'50%\'}}\\n    muted\\n    loop\\n    autoPlay\\n    playsInline\\n    preload=\\"metadata\\"\\n  ></video>\\n</div>\\n<p style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>_Pyrefly (left) vs Pyright (right) autocomplete speed comparison_</p>\\n\\nThese early results are certainly promising indications of a smoother developer experience for Meta engineers, and we\'re excited to share more insights as developers continue using Pyrefly. But Pyrefly isn\u2019t just for Meta developers, it\u2019s open source and ready for everyone to explore\\\\! If you\u2019re curious about Pyrefly\u2019s language server features and want to see how to get it up and running in your IDE, keep reading\\\\!\\n\\n## **Pyrefly LSP at a Glance**\\n\\nWhile Pyrefly is still in Alpha as of the time of posting, it already supports most of the essential IDE capabilities that Python developers rely on daily, such as:\\n\\n- **Autocomplete:** predicts what you\u2019re likely to type next, reducing the need to remember exact names of variables, functions, and others, even importing them automatically for you\\n- **Go to Definition**: allows you to jump directly to the source of a function, class, or variable with a single click.\\n- **Hover:** when you hover over a symbol, Pyrefly displays useful information such as type annotations, documentation, and inferred types.\\n- **Rename symbols**: right click to rename variables, functions, or classes across the entire codebase.\\n- **Typechecking**: Pyrefly will also show type errors and infer types, which you can toggle on or off in your Pyrefly settings (more info in the next section)\\n- **And many more**\\\\! explore the full list and details in the [Pyrefly IDE docs](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/).\\n\\nThe Pyrefly team and our open-source community are continuously working on improvements and new features so stay tuned for updates\\\\! We also want to hear from you \\\\- what features do you need to make your IDE experience better? [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or [join our discord](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W) to share your thoughts.\\n\\n## **How to add Pyrefly to your IDE**\\n\\nPyrefly can be used in a range of IDEs, including standard GUI editors like **VSCode** or **Pycharm**, terminal editors like **Neovim** or **Emacs**, and AI editors like **Cursor** or **Windsurf**. You can check out the full list of supported IDEs in the [Pyrefly IDE docs](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/).\\n\\nFor GUI editors, setup is pretty straightforward and generally follows the same steps:\\n\\n1. Search for \u201cpyrefly\u201d in the appropriate extension marketplace for your IDE and install it\\n2. Open any Python file and the extension will activate automatically\\n3. **Note**: if using an editor other than VSCode you may need to uninstall the default Python LSP in your editor. You can do this by opening your extension settings and setting `\\"Language Server: None\\"`\\n4. **Optional**: we recommend all developers use a typechecker as part of their regular software development process, however we know that type errors in your IDE can be noisy, so the type errors feature is not turned on by default if you don\'t have a `pyrefly.toml` (from `pyrefly init`). If you DO want type errors to show up in your editor everywhere (as red squiggles), you should update your extension settings to include `\\"python.pyrefly.displayTypeErrors\\": \\"force-on\\"`\\n\\n![](./blog_imgs/ide-settings.png)\\n\\nFor terminal editors the setup process can vary depending on which editor you use so check out the [installation documentation](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/#other-editors) for specific instructions.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nAs Python projects continue to grow in size and complexity, having a fast, reliable, and scalable language server is essential for maintaining developer productivity (and our sanity to be honest). So if you\u2019re working on a large codebase and want an LSP designed with scalability in mind we invite you to give Pyrefly a try\\\\!\\n\\nWhile the project is still in Alpha we\u2019re especially eager to hear from more users like you about how the IDE extension performs on real world codebases.

The report emphasises the popularity of the language in the growing fields of AI, data science and scientific computing \\\\- fields where speedy experimentation and iteration are critical, and where developers are coming from a broad range of STEM backgrounds, not necessarily computer science. But as the Python community expands and projects grow from experiments to production systems, that same flexibility can become a liability.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why today we\u2019re going to talk about typed Python \\\\- what it is, why it\u2019s become important for Python developers today, and how to get started using it to write higher quality, more reliable code.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is Typed Python?\\n\\nBefore we dive into why you should be using typed Python in your daily development lives, first we need to understand some core concepts and how we got here.\\n\\n### Dynamic vs static typing\\n\\nThe classic Python programming language that you know and love is _dynamically typed_. What does that mean exactly? It means that types are determined at runtime, not when you write your code. Variables can hold any type of value, and you don\'t need to declare what type they are.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of dynamic typing in action:\\n\\n```py\\nx = 5        # x is an integer\\nx = \\"hello\\"  # now x is a string\\nx = [1,2,3]  # now x is a list\\n```\\n\\nThis behaviour is one of the things that sets Python apart from languages that are _statically typed_, like Java or C++, which require you to declare types from the get go:\\n\\n```c\\nint x = 5;\\nstd::string x_str = \\"hello\\";\\nstd::vector<int> x_vec = {1, 2, 3};\\n```\\n\\nIn the above example we can\u2019t just reassign the variable `x` to a value of whatever type we want, it can only hold an integer because of the static typing nature of the C++ language.\\n\\nThe fact that Python is a dynamically typed language is one of the reasons it is so easy to use and popular amongst new and experienced programmers alike. It makes it easy to develop quick demos, experimental research and proof of concepts, without needing to spend precious development time declaring types. This flexibility has been instrumental in Python\'s adoption in AI, data science, and scientific computing, where researchers need to rapidly iterate and experiment with different approaches.\\n\\nHowever\u2026 (surely you knew there was a \u201cbut\u201d coming?)\\n\\nWe are quickly moving past the \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d phase for many of these industries. AI and machine learning efforts are actively being integrated into production applications, and with that comes production-level expectations of reliability and stability. Relying on dynamic typing opens these codebases up to a certain level of risk that may not be acceptable at the scale they are now expected to operate.\\n\\n### Enter PEP 484: Static Typing Comes to Python\\n\\nCast your mind back to September 2014: Germany has just won the world cup, skinny jeans are still in fashion and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake it Off\u201d is number 1 on the charts. That same month [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) was first created, proposing the addition of type hints to Python, and fundamentally changing how future developers would be able to write and maintain Python code.\\n\\nWith PEP 484\u2019s acceptance and introduction in Python 3.5, developers could now use static type annotations to declare the expected data types of function arguments and return values, and [subsequent PEPs have continually added more features](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/python-features-and-peps/) to expand and refine Python\'s type system. Today you can write statically typed Python statements like this:\\n\\n```py\\ndef my_func(x: int, y: str) -> bool:\\n    z: str = str(x)\\n    return z == y\\n```\\n\\nThe key innovation of PEP 484 was introducing a _gradual_ type system that allows developers to slowly add type annotations over time without breaking existing code. The system works by:\\n\\n- Only type-checking functions that have explicit return or parameter annotations\\n- Introducing the `Any` type as an escape hatch that has all possible attributes\\n- Assuming untyped functions implicitly return `Any`\\n\\nThis approach has meant developers can incrementally adopt typing, while still allowing them to take advantage of the default dynamic typing approach that makes Python so easy to work with and ideal for quick prototyping.\\n\\n## Benefits of Python Type Hints: Write Better Code, Faster\\n\\nSo why specifically should you start using type hints in your Python code? Python type hints offer a range of advantages that can significantly improve the quality, maintainability, and scalability of your codebase, at the same time making it easier for other developers to understand your code and collaborate with you.\\n\\n### Types help you catch bugs early\\n\\nType hints assist static analysis tools in identifying mismatches and potential errors before the code is executed, allowing for early bug detection. Take the following example:\\n\\n```py\\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\\n       return a + b\\n...\\nadd_numbers(3, \\"4\\")  # Potential error\\n```\\n\\nThe above error might be easy to spot when you\u2019re calling the function so close to where you\u2019re defining it, but imagine you\u2019re working across multiple files and/or with many lines of code separating them \\\\- suddenly it\u2019s not so easy\\\\!\\n\\nIn comparison, if you\u2019re using type hints in conjunction with a typechecking tool (such as Pyrefly or MyPy), you can catch this error much earlier \\\\- when you\u2019re actually writing the code, rather than when it fails at runtime:\\n\\n```py\\ndef add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n  return a + b\\n...\\nadd_numbers(3, \\"4\\")  # a typechecker will catch this error at time of writing\\n```\\n\\nUsing a typechecker to highlight these types of errors also ensures you can catch an error like this even if you\u2019ve missed this code path in your unit tests.\\n\\n### Typed code is self-documenting\\n\\nAnother benefit of writing typed Python is that using function signatures and variable annotations provide clarity of intent for a given piece of code. In other words, it makes code easier to read and review. It makes refactoring safer and more predictable. It even helps new team members get up to speed quickly on what\u2019s going on in your codebase without wasting their own time, or yours\\\\!\\n\\nTake the following example, without type hints you have to carefully read the internal function code to understand what type of parameters will work and what will be returned:\\n\\n```py\\ndef calculate_stats(data, weights):\\n    total = 0\\n    weighted_sum = 0\\n    for i, value in enumerate(data):\\n        if i < len(weights):\\n            weighted_sum += value * weights[i]\\n            total += weights[i]\\n    avg = weighted_sum / total if total > 0 else 0\\n    return avg, len(data)\\n```\\n\\nWith this version, you can tell instantly what type of arguments you should be passing and what you should expect to get back \\\\- saving precious dev time and just generally making your life easier:\\n\\n```py\\ndef calculate_stats(data: list[float], weights: list[float]) -> tuple[float, int]:\\n    total = 0\\n    weighted_sum = 0\\n    for i, value in enumerate(data):\\n        if i < len(weights):\\n            weighted_sum += value * weights[i]\\n            total += weights[i]\\n    avg = weighted_sum / total if total > 0 else 0\\n    return avg, len(data)\\n```\\n\\nI know I know \\\\- ideally all developers should be adding clear docstrings with every function they write, but we know in reality it doesn\u2019t always shape up that way\\\\! Adding type hints is quicker than writing a typical docstring, won\u2019t go stale (if enforced using a typechecker) and is better than no documentation at all. Modern Python typecheckers also have [IDE extensions](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/) that include autocomplete functionality to make life easier.\\n\\n### Typed Python helps you scale from proof-of-concept to production-ready\\n\\nOne of the most important benefits of using type annotations in your code is that it helps you scale your code faster and with less risk. For developers today, the pipeline from experimental code to production systems moves faster than ever, especially in AI and machine learning workflows where research prototypes must quickly evolve into robust, scalable applications.\\n\\nFor example, say there is a team of data scientists that has just published their findings and now needs to operationalize their models. If their published code already includes type hints it makes it much easier, quicker and safer for an engineering team to step in and integrate that research into production applications. In situations like these, type annotations act as a contract between different stages of development, making it clear how data flows through complex, multi-step processing pipelines. This is particularly valuable in AI workflows where a single type mismatch, like passing a NumPy array where a PyTorch tensor is expected, can cause silent failures or performance degradation that only surfaces under production load.\\n\\n## Get Started with Typed Python today\\\\!\\n\\nSo now you know what typed python is and why you should be doing it, how can you actually get started adding types to your code?\\n\\n### Step 0 \\\\- start early\\\\!\\n\\nAs a general rule of thumb, the earlier in a project you start adding type annotations the better.\\nType hints are much easier to add as you go than to retrofit across an entire codebase later.\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned before, one of the great benefits of Python is that its dynamic typing default makes it very flexible and easy to get started with. So when you\u2019re doing your initial experimentation and prototyping maybe you\u2019re not thinking about making sure it\u2019s type safe \\\\- and that\u2019s ok\\\\! But as soon as you start to think your project might be going somewhere, if more than one person might be working on it, using it or just reading it, you should start adding type hints.\\n\\n### Step 1 \\\\- install a type checker\\n\\nChoose and install a type checker that fits your needs. Typecheckers leverage the code annotations you write to provide important errors and warnings to ensure your codebase is type safe.\\n\\nAt Meta, we recommend [Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/), our new open-source type checker built in Rust. Pyrefly is designed to scale from small projects to massive codebases incredibly fast, while providing excellent developer experience. Read the [Pyrefly documentation](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/) to understand configuration options and best practices, then start adding simple type hints to new functions before gradually working your way up to more complex scenarios.\\n\\nYou should also consider working with a typechecker that [supports IDE integration](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/IDE/) to get real-time feedback as you write code. Pyrefly provides extensions for editors like VS Code, PyCharm, and Vim which will highlight errors and provide autocomplete suggestions based on your type annotations.\\n\\nAdding your typechecker to your CI processes is also valuable for maintaining code quality at scale. You can [configure your CI/CD pipeline to run type checking](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/#add-pyrefly-to-ci) on every pull request, treating type errors as build failures.\\n\\n### Step 2 \\\\- make use of resources to get better at typing\\n\\nTyping is one of those skills that gets better the more you practice it in your code, but there are also great resources out there for getting to grips with the functionality and diving deeper into the concepts:\\n\\n- Official [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) documentation \\\\- The typing module docs provide comprehensive coverage of all available types\\n- [PEP 484 and related PEPs](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/python-features-and-peps/) \\\\- Understanding the foundational specifications helps you grasp the \\"why\\" behind typing decisions\\n- Documentation for your chosen typechecker, e.g. [Pyrefly Docs on learning typing](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/typing-for-python-developers/)\\n- Join community forums and get support, e.g. [Pyrefly Discord](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W), [Typing Discourse](https://discuss.python.org/c/typing)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo there you have it \\\\- a quick trip around the world of Python typing\\\\! By now you\u2019ve hopefully learnt that type hints aren\'t just another Python feature to add to the long list of things you\u2019ll _definitely_ get round to implementing eventually \\\\- they\'re a practical investment in your code\'s future. The upfront effort of adding type hints pays dividends in reduced debugging sessions, smoother code reviews, and fewer production issues. Most importantly, they give you the confidence to refactor and scale your codebase without fear of breaking things in unexpected ways. Start small by adding type annotations to your next function, add a type checker to your workflow, and before you know it writing typed Python will be second nature. Your future self (and your users and teammates\\\\!) will thank you."},{"id":"introducing-pyrefly","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing-pyrefly","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-15-pyrefly-intro.md","title":"Introducing Pyrefly - A new type checker and IDE experience for Python","description":"Today we are announcing an alpha version of Pyrefly, an open source Python typechecker and IDE extension crafted in Rust","date":"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"typechecking","permalink":"/blog/tags/typechecking"},{"inline":true,"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":4.69,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Pyrefly Team","url":"https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly","key":"pyreflyteam","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing Pyrefly - A new type checker and IDE experience for Python","description":"Today we are announcing an alpha version of Pyrefly, an open source Python typechecker and IDE extension crafted in Rust","slug":"introducing-pyrefly","authors":["pyreflyteam"],"tags":["typechecking","news"],"image":"https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pyrefly-Feature-Image.jpg","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Today\u2019s Python Developers Are Embracing Type Hints","permalink":"/blog/why-typed-python"}},"content":"<head>\\n    <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/15/developer-tools/introducing-pyrefly-a-new-type-checker-and-ide-experience-for-python/\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n![Pyrefly Intro](./blog_imgs/pyrefly_intro.webp)\\n\\nToday we are announcing an alpha version of Pyrefly, an open source Python typechecker and IDE extension crafted in Rust. Pyrefly is a static type checker that analyzes Python code to ensure type consistency and help you catch errors throughout your codebase before your code runs. It also supports IDE integration and CLI usage to give you flexibility in how you incorporate it into your workflow.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe open source community is the backbone of the Python language. We are eager to collaborate on Pyrefly with the community and improve Python\u2019s type system and the many libraries that we all rely on.\\n\\n## Get started\\n\\nReady to dive in? The [official Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org/) has all the details, but to quickly get started:\\n\\n- [Install](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) Pyrefly on the command-line: pip install pyrefly.\\n- [Migrate your existing type checker configuration to Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/migrating-to-pyrefly/).\\n- Enhance Your IDE: Download the [Pyrefly extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) and enjoy a lightning fast IDE experience from starter projects to monorepos.\\n- Leave feedback for us on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).\\n\\n## Why we built Pyrefly\\n\\nBack in 2017, we embarked on a mission to create a type checker that could handle [Instagram\u2019s massive codebas](https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366) of typed Python. This mission led to the birth of the [Pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) type checker, inspired by the robust designs of [Hack](https://hacklang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/), and written in OCaml to deliver scalable performance.\\n\\nOver the years, Pyre served us well, but as the type system evolved and the need for typechecking to drive responsive IDE emerged, it was clear that we needed to take a new approach. We explored alternate solutions and leveraged community tools like [Pyright](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright) for code navigation. But the need for an extensible type checker that can bring code navigation, checking at scale, and exporting types to other services drove us to start over, creating Pyrefly.\\n\\n## The principles behind Pyrefly\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to unveil Pyrefly, a project [we\u2019ve been developing openly on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly). We invite you to explore our work and try it out on your own project. While a project like Pyrefly is the sum of thousands of technical choices, a few notable principles we\u2019ve followed are:\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nWe want to shift checks that used to happen later on CI to happening on every single keystroke. That requires checking code at speed (on large codebases we can check 1.8 million lines of code per second!) and careful thought to incrementality and updates. Pyrefly is implemented in Rust and designed for high performance on codebases of all sizes.\\n\\n### IDE first\\n\\nWe want the IDE and command line to share a consistent view of the world, which means crafting abstractions that capture the differences without incurring unnecessary costs. Designing these abstractions from the beginning is much easier than retrofitting them, which we tried with Pyre.\\n\\n### Inference\\n\\nSome [Python programs are typed](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/09/developer-tools/typed-python-2024-survey-meta/), but many aren\u2019t. We want users to benefit from types even if they haven\u2019t annotated their code \u2013 so automatically infer types for returns and local variables and display them in the IDE. What\u2019s more, in the IDE you can even double click to insert these inferred types if you think that would make the program better.\\n\\n### Open source\\n\\nPython is open source, and hugely popular. The [Python typing specification](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/) is open source, which made Pyrefly vastly easier to develop. Many of the libraries Meta contributes to are open source,( e.g., [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)).\\n\\nPyrefly is also open source, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/LICENSE), and we encourage [pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/pulls) and [issue reports](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues). We also have a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W) for more free flowing discussions. We would love to build a community around Pyrefly.\\n\\n## The future of Pyrefly\\n\\nWe will work with the Python community to drive the language forward and improve the developer experience. Since the beginning of Pyre, we open sourced our code and contributed a number of PEPs alongside the community of type checker maintainers. We feel we can do more with Pyrefly to help Python developers leverage the benefits of types for developers, library authors, and folks just learning the language.\\n\\nMeta has leveraged types in dynamic languages from the beginning and knows the significant benefits it brings to developer productivity and security. We plan to share more of our learnings and tooling with [blogs](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/09/developer-tools/typed-python-2024-survey-meta/), better types in the ecosystem and language enhancements.\\n\\nToday we\u2019re releasing Pyrefly as an alpha. At the same time, we\u2019re busy burning down the long-tail of bugs and features aiming to remove the alpha label this Summer. Your feedback is invaluable to get there, so please give it a try and [report your bugs](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or things you think can be improved. Even if Pyrefly isn\u2019t right for your project, we would love to hear how you use types and what you would like to see improved in your editor.\\n\\nJoin us on the journey as we help illuminate your bugs with Pyrefly. Happy coding! \ud83d\udc0d\u2728\\n\\n## Hear more about Pyrefly\\n\\nCheck out the [episode of the Meta Tech Podcast](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/15/developer-tools/open-sourcing-pyrefly-a-faster-python-type-checker-written-in-rust) where several team members share their experience developing Pyrefly and technical details for how it works.
