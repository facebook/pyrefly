Fast forward to today: many programmers still face the reality that, despite their best coding intentions, as projects grow in size and complexity, so do their codebases. Even when a project scales to millions of lines of code, developers still expect their IDE to be fast, accurate, and efficient. And with increasingly large and interconnected (dare I say, spaghetti?) code, you probably rely on your IDE even more to help you navigate the chaos (ahem I mean complexity)."]})]})}function g(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return a?(0,n.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},54372:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/2025/09/15/ide-extension","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-15-ide-extension.mdx","title":"Give your Python IDE a Glow-Up with Pyrefly","description":"Learn how Pyrefly\'s language server capabilities can help you navigate large Python codebases with ease.","date":"2025-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"language-server","permalink":"/blog/tags/language-server"},{"inline":true,"label":"IDE","permalink":"/blog/tags/ide"}],"readingTime":6.135,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abby Mitchell","url":"https://github.com/javabster","key":"abbym","page":null},{"name":"Kyle Into","url":"https://www.kylei.dev/","key":"kylei","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Give your Python IDE a Glow-Up with Pyrefly","description":"Learn how Pyrefly\'s language server capabilities can help you navigate large Python codebases with ease.","authors":["abbym","kylei"],"tags":["language-server","IDE"],"image":"https://pyrefly.org/assets/images/ide-blog-hero-22aa9f0c1c4873f0e6c18e02faf40823.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Bringing NumPy\'s type-completeness score to nearly 90%","permalink":"/blog/numpy-type-completeness"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Today\u2019s Python Developers Are Embracing Type Hints","permalink":"/blog/why-typed-python"}}')}}]);
