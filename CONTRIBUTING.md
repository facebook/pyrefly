## Developer cheat sheet

### GitHub developers

The [rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is required for
development. You can use the normal `cargo` commands (e.g. `cargo build`,
`cargo test`).

You can also run `python3 test.py` from this directory to use our all-in-one
test script that auto-formats your code, runs the tests, and updates the
conformance test results. It requires Python 3.9+.

Refer to other sections of the document for
[coding conventions](#coding-conventions) and where to add
[new tests](#testing).

### Meta internal developers

From this directory, you can run:

- Check things are plausible: `./test.py` (runs the basic tests and linter)
- Run a command: `buck2 run pyrefly -- COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS`
  - For example, run on a single file: `buck2 run pyrefly -- check test.py`
- Run a single test: `buck2 test pyrefly -- NAME_OF_THE_TEST`
- Run the end-to-end tests: `buck2 test test:`
- Run `arc pyre` (a.k.a. per-target type checking) with Pyrefly:
  `arc pyre check <targets_to_check> -c python.type_checker=fbcode//pyrefly:pyrefly_for_buck`
- Debug a file: `buck2 run pyrefly -- check <filename> --debug-info=debug.js`,
  then open `debug.html` in your browser
- Fetch Typeshed from upstream
  `HTTPS_PROXY=https://fwdproxy:8080 fbpython scripts/fetch_typeshed.py -o pyrefly/third_party`

## Packaging

We use [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) to build wheels and source
distributions. This also means that you can pip install `maturin` and use
`maturin build` and `maturin develop` for local development. `pip install .` in
the `pyrefly/pyrefly` directory works as well.

### Deploying to PyPI (Meta internal)

Once a week, a
[CodemodService job](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/xplat/scripts/codemod_service/configs/fbcode_pyrefly_version_upgrade.toml)
generates a diff to update the version number. Accept this diff to upload a new
version to PyPI.

If you'd like to do a manual release between the weekly automated releases,
follow the instructions in
[version.bzl](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/fbcode/pyrefly/version.bzl)
to update the version number.

Behind the scenes, what's happening is:

- The
  [publish_to_pypi workflow](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_to_pypi.yml)
  triggers on any change to version.bzl.
- This workflow calls the
  [build_binaries workflow](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_binaries.yml)
  to build release artifacts, uploads them, and tags the corresponding commit
  with the version number.

## Coding conventions

We follow the
[Buck2 coding conventions](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/blob/main/HACKING.md#coding-conventions),
with the caveat that we use our internal error framework for errors reported by
the type checker.

## Testing

Here's where you can add new integration tests, based on the type of issue
you're working on:

- configurations: `test/`
- type checking: `pyrefly/lib/test/`
- language server: `pyrefly/lib/test/lsp/`

Please do not add tests in `conformance/third_party`. Those test cases are a
copy of the official Python typing conformance tests, and any changes you make
there will be overwritten the next time we pull in the latest version of the
tests.

Running `./test.py` will re-generate Pyrefly's conformance test outputs. Those
changes should be committed.

## Developing Pyrefly

We do not yet have development docs ready in this repository, they should be
coming soon.

If you are interested in working on Pyrefly, please file an issue and we'll work
on the docs for this.
