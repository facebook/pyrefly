# Welcome to the Pyrefly Sandbox, this is a page
# where you can write, share and learn about typing in Python.
#
# Here are a couple features of this sandbox:
# - Get real-time type checking feedback
# - Use reveal_type() to inspect inferred types
# - experiment with the IDE features that we support (e.g. autocomplete, go-to-definition, hover, etc)
# - Write and run Python code directly in your browser

# reveal_type will produce a type error that tells you the type Pyrefly has
# computed for the return (in this case, str)
