# Pyrefly in the IDE
Pyrefly seamlessly integrates into IDEs with our [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) and [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/meta/pyrefly) extensions. For other editors like vim/emacs, see [other editors](#other-editors).

## Quick start
1. Install the Pyrefly extension from the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/meta/pyrefly)
2. Open a python file and the extension will activate

## Features
The Pyrefly extension provides:
- Inline type errors matching the Pyrefly command-line
- Types shown inline and on hover
- Go-to definition
- Autocomplete / intellisense

## Customization
By default, Pyrefly should work in the IDE with no configuration necessary. But to ensure your project is set up properly, see [configurations](../configuration).

The following configuration options are IDE-specific:
- `python.pyrefly.disableLanguageServices` [boolean: false]: by default, Pyrefly will provide both type errors and other language features like go-to definition, intellisense, hover, etc. Enable this option to keep type errors from Pyrefly but use VSCode's Python extension for everything else.

If the project configuration does not specify the Python interpreter, Pyrefly will use the [interpreter selected in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).
