# Error Kinds

An _error kind_ categorizes an error by the part of the typing specification
that an error is related to. Every error has exactly one kind.

The main use of error kinds is as short names ("slugs") that can be used in
error suppression comments.

placeholder for error kinds

## annotation-mismatch

This error indicates a mismatch between multiple annotations for a single
variable. This is relatively uncommon, but it can happen in if-statements:

```python
if some_cond:
    x: int = 1
else:
    x: str = "two" # Inconsistent type annotations for x: str, int [annotation-mismatch]
```

It can be helpful to annotate the variable before branch, especially if there is
a useful default value for it. For example:

```python
x: str = "default"
if some_cond:
  x = "actual value"
```

## assert-type

An `assert-type` error is raised when a `typing.assert_type()` call fails.

This error kind should never be suppressed, since that rather defeats the point
of of `typing.assert_type()`.

## async-error

`async-error` is reported when attempting to `await` on something that is not
awaitable. This may indicate that a function should have been marked `async` but
wasn't.

```python
def some_func() -> None:
  ...

await some_func() # Expression is not awaitable [async-error]
```

This will also arise if the context manager used in an `async with` statement
has `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods that are not marked `async`.

The fix is to use an `async` function in the `await`. This may mean making the
function `async` or finding an existing `async` function to use instead.

## bad-argument-count

This error arises when a function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

```python
def takes_three(one: int, two: int, three: int) -> complex:
  ...

take_three(3, 2)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
```

Note that `missing-argument` will be raised if pyrefly can identify that
specific arguments are missing. As such, this error is more likely to appear
when too many args are supplied, rather than too few.

This example shows both kinds of errors:

```python
from typing import Callable
def apply(f: Callable[[int, int], int]) -> int:
    return f(1)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
apply() # Missing argument `f` in function `apply` [missing-argument]
```

## bad-argument-type

This error indicates that the function was called with an argument of the wrong
type.

```python
def example(x: int) -> None:
  ...
example("one")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter `x` with type `int` in function `example` [bad-argument-type]
```

This can also happen with `*args` and `**kwargs`:

```python
def bad_args(*args: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(1, "two")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter with type `int` in function `bad_args` [bad-argument-type]
```

```python
def bad_kwargs(**kwargs: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(x=1, y="two")  # Keyword argument `y` with type `Literal['two']` is not assignable to kwargs type `int` in function `bad_kwargs` [bad-argument-type]
```

## bad-assignment

The most common cause of this error is attempting to assign a value that conflicts with the variable's type annotation.

```python
x: str = 1 # `Literal[1]` is not assignable to `str` [bad-assignment]
```

However, it can occur in several other situations.

Here, `x` is marked as `Final`, so assigning a new value to it is an error.

```python
from typing import Final
x: Final = 1
x = 2 # `x` is marked final [bad-assignment]
```

In another case, attempting to annotate an assignment to an instance attribute raises this error.

```python
class A:
    x: int
a = A()
a.x: int = 2  # Type cannot be declared in assignment to non-self attribute `a.x` [bad-assignment]
```

## bad-class-definition

This error indicates that there is something wrong with the class definition.
It tends to be a bit rarer, since most issues would be tagged with other error kinds, such as
`annotation-mismatch` or one of the function errors.
inheritance has its own complexities, so it has its own error kind called `invalid-inheritance`.

One place you may see it is dynamic class generation:

```python
from enum import Enum
Ex = Enum("Ex", [("Red", 1), ("Blue", 2), ("Red", 3)])  # Duplicate field `Red` [bad-class-definition]
```

However, it is best practice to use the class syntax if possible, which doesn't treat duplicate names as an error.

## bad-function-definition

Like `bad-class-definition`, this error kind is uncommon because other error kinds are used for more specific issues.
For example, argument order is enforced by the parser, so `def f(x: int = 1, y: str)` is a `parse-error`.

## bad-keyword-argument

Attempting to call a function with an incorrect keyword argument. e.g. f(x=1,
x=2), or perhaps f(y=1) (where `f` has no parameter `y`).

## bad-override

A subclass field or method incorrectly overrides a field/method of a parent
class.

## bad-return

Attempting to return a value that does not match the function's return type. Can
also arise when returning values from generators.

## bad-specialization

Attempting to specialize a generic class with incorrect type arguments. e.g.
`type[int, str]` is an error because `type` accepts only 1 type arg.

## bad-unpacking

An error caused by unpacking. e.g. attempting to unpack an iterable into the
wrong number of variables.

## match-error

An error caused by a bad match statement. e.g. Writing a Foo(x, y, z) pattern
when Foo only matches on (x, y).

## missing-attribute

Attempting to access an attribute that does not exist.

## import-error

An error related to the import machinery. e.g. failed to import a module.

## index-error

Attempting to access a container with an incorrect index. This only occurs when
pyre can statically verify that the index is incorrect.

## internal-error

Internal Pyre error.

## invalid-annotation

Attempting to write an annotation that is invalid for some reason.

## invalid-argument

Passing an argument that is invalid for reasons besides type.

## invalid-inheritance

An error caused by incorrect inheritance in a class or type definition. e.g. a
metaclass that is not a subclass of `type`.

## invalid-literal

Attempting to use a value that is not a valid kind of Literal.

## invalid-overload

An error caused by incorrect usage of the @overload decorator. e.g. not defining
multiple variants for an overloaded function.

## invalid-param-spec

An error related to ParamSpec definition or usage.

## invalid-super-call

Attempting to call `super()` in a way that is not allowed. e.g. calling
`super(Y, x)` on an object `x` that does not match the class `Y`.

## invalid-type-var

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVar.

## invalid-type-var-tuple

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVarTuple.

## invalid-yield

Attempting to use `yield` in a way that is not allowed. e.g. `yield from` with
something that's not an iterable.

## missing-argument

An error caused by calling a function without all the required arguments. Should
be used when we can name the specific arguments that are missing.

## missing-module-attribute

Accessing an attribute that does not exist on a module.

## no-access

The attribute exists but does not support this access pattern.

## no-matching-overload

Attempting to call an overloaded function, but none of the signatures match.

## not-a-type

Attempting to use something that isn't a type where a type is expected. This is
a very general error and should be used sparingly.

## not-callable

Attempting to call a value that is not a callable.

## not-iterable

Attempting to use a non-iterable value as an iterable.

## parse-error

An error related to parsing or syntax.

## read-only

The attribute exists but cannot be modified.

## reveal-type

Raised by a call to `reveal_type()`.

## type-alias-error

An error related to type alias usage or definition.

## typed-dict-key-error

An error related to TypedDict keys. e.g. attempting to access a TypedDict with a
key that does not exist.

## unexpected-keyword

An error caused by a keyword argument used in the wrong place.

## unknown-name

Attempting to use a name that is not defined.

## unsupported-operand

Attempting to apply an operator to arguments that do not support it.

## unsupported

Attempting to use a feature that is not yet supported.
