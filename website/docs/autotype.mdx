# Pyrefly Infer

Manually adding type annotations to your code can be tedius and time-consuming. Pyrefly can help with this task by automatically adding type annotations to your code.

This feature is currently under active development, and the following sections will be updated as the feature matures. We currently recommend manually reviewing the changes created by `pyrefly infer`

## Usage

To use the infer feature, run the following command in your project directory:

```
pyrefly infer path/to/file.py
# or
pyrefly infer path/to/directory/
```

We recommend running it in small batches to make reviewing and merging changes easier. Flags can be used to turn on / off adding annotations for parameters, return types, and containers.

It is common that new annotations will expose new type errors. See our error suppression guides to learn how to automate silencing these errors.
