# Import Resolution

This doc describes how imports in a given file are found and their bindings are
resolved, including files that are being type checked.

NOTE: see the [Configuration documentation](./configuration.mdx) for more info on
the config items referenced below.

## Relative Imports

If the import is relative (starting with one or more dots), the import is
resolved relative to the path of the file importing it. A single dot at the
beginning of the import (e.g. `.file.to.import`) represents the current
directory, and more dots (e.g. `..other.file`) will continue to walk upward.

## Absolute Imports

For absolute imports, Pyrefly uses the following import strategy:

1. Try to import from each entry in [`search_path`](./configuration.mdx#search_path) in the order they appear
   using the module finding strategy. a. NOTE: we append the config file's
   directory to `search_path` automatically when using a config file as a
   sensible last-resort for attempting an import.
2. Try to import from `typeshed`.
3. Try to find a stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in
   [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path).
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
   See [the typing spec](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-only-packages) for
   more info on stub packages.
    1. If we find a `-stubs` package, but there's no non-stubs package, return an import error.
4. Try to find a non-stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in `site_package_path`.
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
5. Return an import error.

See [Site Package Path Typing Rules](#site-package-path-typing-rules) for more information about which
modules are valid imports from [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path), and
how to override that behavior.

### Site Package Path Typing Rules

We respect typing rules as defined by the typing spec for
[stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-only-packages),
[partial stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#partial-stub-packages),
and [py.typed](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#packaging-type-information) files.
That means:
- if we can find any `-stubs` package, we do not fall back to non-stubs packages unless any of them contain a
  `py.typed` file in their top-level containing the content `partial\n`.
- if we can't find any `-stubs` packages, only accept a package's types if it contains a `py.typed` file. Here,
  we only check for the existence of the file, not for any contents.

You can control the above behavior with the following two configs:
- [`use_untyped_imports`](./configuration.mdx#use_untyped_imports): don't worry about looking for any `py.typed`
  file. Check for `-stubs` first and fall back to non-stubs, regardless of the presence of a `py.typed` with
  `partial\n` or if the non-stubs packages contain a `py.typed`.
- [`ignore_missing_source`](./configuration.mdx#ignore_missing_source): don't try to check for a backing non-stubs
  package when we find a `-stubs` pacakge. Immediately return the `-stubs` package when found.

## Stub Files vs Source Files

A
[stub file](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files)
is any file that ends with a `.pyi` file suffix. They have many uses, including
adding typing to non-Python extension code, distributing typing information
separate from implementation, or overriding an implementation with more accurate
typing information.

A stub package is a second package corresponding to a regular package, with `-stubs`
appended to its name. A `-stubs` package should only include stub files (`.pyi`),
which override any `.py` or `.pyi` files in the non-stubs package. These are preferred
when available, since they contain the interfaces a library exposes to developers. An
example of this includes the popular library [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas),
and its stub package, [`pandas-stubs`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs).

When importing from a non-stubs package, Pyrefly loads typing information from
imports by first searching for a relevant `-stubs` package, then by looking at
the non-stubs package's `.pyi` files, then falls back to a `.py` file. See
[Absolute Imports](#absolute-imports) for details on when non-stubs packages
are allowed to be used for types, and how you can override that behavior.
